Instructions:
The capstone project is your opportunity to demonstrate your Web Development skills by creating a full stack application. You will work individually to create an application, including all the MVP features and adding as many extra features as time allows.

If you want to work in a team,  you will need to gather your desired team members, fill out a provided application, and submit it to your instructor for approval. If you work in a group, you have one of three options: Option 1: work with a group to create a review site like Yelp, TripAdvisor, Goodreads, etc., Option 2: work in a group to create an e-commerce site like Amazon, Monoprice, or eBay, or Option 3: Create a full stack application of your choice, with approval from the instructional team.

Once you make your choice, you should look closely through the product requirements and determine which features you would like to implement.

For all projects, Tier 1: MVP is required. An MVP, or Minimum Viable Product, describes the absolute minimum features a product needs to be usable for its main purpose. Tiers 2 and 3 for each project describe more complex, useful, or design-oriented features that improve a product's chances in the market.

Your may choose any, all, or none of the features in Tiers 2 or 3 to implement, but choose wisely. Once your project deadline is reached, you must present a working website with some working features to demonstrate to your fellow learners and instructional team members.
